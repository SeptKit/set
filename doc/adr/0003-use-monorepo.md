# 3. Use Monorepo

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We will have separate packages in the project, that will share some common code.

## Decision

We will use a monorepo because it is easier to manage dependencies and share code between packages.
With separate repositories, the management of dependencies takes more effort.

## Consequences

Easier management of dependencies and shared code.
